# Startup Capital Management System

Startup Capital Management System is a dynamic web application designed to facilitate the management of capital participation requests from startup founders seeking funding for their projects, as well as participation requests from venture capitalists. The system allows startup founders to submit participation requests for the financing of their projects in the form of shares, with the hope of selling them to venture capitalists. Venture capitalists, on the other hand, can browse the list of projects and potentially purchase shares in projects that interest them, thereby becoming shareholders.

## Project Overview

The system involves two main actors:

1. **Startup Founder**: Responsible for registering and submitting information about their company, adding projects for funding, and managing project details and participants.
   
2. **Venture Capitalist**: Responsible for registering, browsing projects for investment opportunities, purchasing shares in projects, and managing their investments.
